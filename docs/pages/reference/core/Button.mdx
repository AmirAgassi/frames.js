# Button

In order to render buttons you should use our `<Button>` component. Frames.js supports the following button types:

## Post Button

```tsx
<Button action="post">Click me</Button>
```

This button sends a request to a URL on which it was rendered. If you want to navigate to different route in your app, you can use `target` prop which should be set to relative path.

```tsx
<Button action="post" target="/next-route">
  Click me
</Button>
```

The `target` path will be resolved relatively to current URL.

###Â Passing state when button is clicked

Optionally you can provide a small state to your target when the button is clicked by using `state` prop which accepts any JSON serializable value.

```tsx
<Button action="post" target="/next-route" state={{ foo: "bar" }}>
  Click me
</Button>
```

The state will be available in handler `ctx.clickedButton.state`.

## Post Redirect Button

Post redirect button is a special kind of `post` button that when users clicks the button, first a message is sent to frames handler and then it is expected that handler will redirect the user to a different route using [`redirect`](/reference/redirect) call.

It accepts same props as `post` button.

```tsx
<Button action="post_redirect" target="/next-route" state="optional-state">
  Click me
</Button>
```

## Link Button

Link button navigates to external URL when clicked.

```tsx
<Button action="link" target="https://google.com">
  Click me
</Button>
```

## Mint Button

Mint button creates a new token when clicked.

```tsx
<Button action="mint" target="https://google.com">
  Click me
</Button>
```

## Tx Button
