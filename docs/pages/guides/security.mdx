# Verifying your frame actions 

The default frames.js middleware verifies Frame Actions against corresponding services; for Frames in Farcaster that is via a Farcaster Hub. XMTP Frames are validated against XMTP Frame validation libraries.

The contents of this verification, including additional context can be accessed via the `message` object

```tsx
const handleRequest = frames(async (ctx) => {
    // ctx.message.isValid
    // ctx.message.casterFollowsRequester
    // ...
});
```
